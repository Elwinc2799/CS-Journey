CS learning journey using Obsidian

Hi, I am a junior data analyst and software developer graduated in computer science degree from [School of Computer Sciences](https://cs.usm.my/), [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/). Obsidian looks fun to use and I am jotting down my whole learning journey using it too. Good to see you and enjoy browsing my notes.
